            <strong>To use Git you first have to have it installed in your computer.</strong> 
            You can download your installation from here. 
            <br/>
            <em>Once installed you 
            will have access to two versions of the UI, either a Git GUI or the Git bash.</em>
            <br/> 
            Although you can achieve the same results with both tools, I will base this 
            tutorial only on Git bash, since based on my experience, in the long run is 
            the one that will give you the best results to learn how to use. 
            <br/>
            <i>A lot of the IDEs already have some sort of Git/Github</i> integration so if you feel strongly about a 
            particular IDE I suggest you learn how to use these tools in that IDE.

            <b>The only place where I suggest you prefer a visual tool for using Git is when you need 
            to merge files, we will get there soon.</b>

            <blockquote>
                "Created in 2005 by Linus Torvalds for the maintenance of the Linux Kernel, Git is a version 
                control tool. A version control tool allows you to keep track of your work in incremental steps. 
                This is done through a detailed step by step history that is kept inside the repository. 
                Git thinks of its data more like a series of snapshots of a miniature filesystem. With Git, 
                every time you commit, or save the state of your project, Git basically takes a picture of what 
                all your files look like at that moment and stores a reference to that snapshot. To be efficient, 
                if files have not changed, Git doesnt store the file again, just a link to the previous identical 
                file it has already stored."
